Abstract
This report details the analysis of ∼24 million geo-located tweets from New York City (NYC) in 2020, exploring their relationship with socioeconomic indicators. The workflow involved ac- quiring raw tweet data, cleaning it to remove noise (e.g., URLs, mentions, emojis converted to text), and enriching it with geospatial (ZIP codes) and socioeconomic (median income) fea- tures. Tweets were classified into COVID-19, politics, and economics categories using the twitter- roberta-topic-multi-all model, followed by sentiment analysis (positive: 1, neutral: 0, negative:
-1) with a fine-tuned Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 LLM, handling multilingual content effectively. Ad- ditionally, an incremental learning approach classified emotions (e.g., joy, anger) on the large dataset, achieving an accuracy of 0.7743 with robust precision and recall across emotion classes. Challenges like data noise and geospatial concentration (∼250 unique spots) were addressed, though some visualization biases persisted. Results reveal sentiment and emotion patterns linked to socioeconomic factors, offering insights for urban planning.

Introduction
Background
NYC, a global hub, generated a rich Twitter dataset in 2020, reflecting public reactions to COVID- 19, elections, and economic disruptions. The ∼24 million geo-located tweets, sourced via Twitter API with a 50km radius around NYC (geocode:40.7128,-74.0060), captured diverse sentiments in a multilingual, noisy format, requiring advanced processing for urban insights.

Objectives and Challenges
Objectives included cleaning tweets, enriching with socioeconomic data, classifying into COVID- 19, politics, and economics, and analyzing sentiment and emotions. Challenges were noisy text (e.g., URLs, emojis), missing/invalid geospatial data, multilingual content, and location concen- tration. Solutions used custom Python scripts, transformer models, and incremental learning, with some geospatial biases unresolved.

Data Acquisition and Initial Description
The dataset, a CSV with ∼24 million tweets from NYC (2020), was sourced via Twitter API or public archives. Key columns included “tweet” (noisy text), “Latitude,” and “Longitude.” High tweet volumes aligned with events (e.g., COVID lockdowns, elections). Noise included URLs, mentions, and multilingual text, with geospatial gaps and concentration in ∼250 spots.

Data Understanding and Problem Identification
Using pandas chunking (chunksize=10000), we analyzed tweet length (∼100–150 characters pre- cleaning), lexical diversity (e.g., “covid,” “trump”), and multilingual content (∼80–90% English). Geospatial issues included missing/invalid coordinates and concentration in urban cores. So- cioeconomic data (e.g., income) was absent, limiting correlations.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Cleaning Methodology
A MemoryOptimizedTweetCleaner class processed tweets in chunks, removing URLs, mentions, retweet prefixes, digits, punctuation, HTML, and extra whitespace using regex. Emojis and emoti- cons were converted to text (e.g.,  to “face_with_medical_mask”) for sentiment preservation.

Preservation of Sentiment-Relevant Features
Emojis, emoticons, hashtags (without #), and slang were retained or transformed to maintain emotional context for downstream analysis.

Implementation Details
Parallel processing (ThreadPoolExecutor, max_workers=6–8) handled chunks (∼500MB), with memory monitoring (psutil) and garbage collection. Output was a “cleaned_tweets” column, with ∼95% rows retained after dropping nulls.

Geospatial and Socioeconomic Enrichment
Adding Median Income
ACS data (S1903_C03_001E) and census tract shapefiles (tl_2020_36_tract20.shp) were merged via spatial joins (geopandas, sjoin_nearest). Missing incomes were imputed using neighbor aver- ages.

Adding Incident ZIP Codes
The uszipcode library geocoded rounded lat/long pairs to ZIPs, with defaults (-11414) for invalid coordinates.

Implementation Details
Chunked processing assigned income and ZIPs to valid coordinates (∼high % coverage). Outputs were saved as CSVs, with plots verifying assignments.

Problems Faced, Solutions, and Unsolved Issues
Data Cleanliness (Solved)
Noise (∼20–30% URLs/mentions) was removed, retaining ∼95% cleaned rows.

Missing or Invalid Geospatial Data (Partially Solved)
Valid coordinates were enriched; invalid ones used defaults, leaving some nulls.

Multilingual Content (Solved)
LLMs handled multilingual text without translation, ensuring accurate sentiment.

Location Data Concentration (Unsolved)
Tweets from ∼250 spots biased heatmaps, unresolved due to data limitations.

Sentiment and Emotion Analysis on Classified Tweets
Approach Using LLMs for Sentiment Analysis
Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 was fine-tuned for sentiment (positive: 1, neutral: 0, negative: -1), cap- turing context and multilingual nuances.

Fine-Tuning Tutorial and Multilingual Handling
Fine-tuning used 4-bit quantization, LoRA (r=8), and a small dataset. Multilingual tweets were analyzed directly via LLM pretraining.

Emotion Classification Using Incremental Learning
To extend beyond sentiment polarity, an incremental learning approach classified emotions (e.g., joy, anger, sadness) on the large dataset, complementing the sentiment analysis by providing deeper emotional insights.
Methodology: The approach used a feature extraction technique to convert cleaned tweet text into numerical representations suitable for large-scale processing. A classifier was trained incrementally to handle the ∼24 million tweets efficiently, accommodating the dataset’s size without requiring extensive computational resources. The process involved:
Validation Set Creation: A sample of 500,000 tweets was used to create a balanced training and validation set, split 80:20, ensuring representation of all emotion categories (e.g., joy, anger, sadness, fear).
Incremental Training: The dataset was processed in chunks of 100,000 tweets. Each chunk’s text was transformed into sparse feature vectors, capturing unigrams and bigrams for con- textual understanding. The classifier was updated iteratively, learning from each chunk while maintaining memory efficiency. The first chunk established the set of emotion la- bels, with subsequent chunks refining the model.
Evaluation: The trained classifier was evaluated on the validation set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance across emotion categories.
Model Persistence: The trained classifier and feature extractor were saved for future use, ensuring reproducibility and scalability.
Implementation Details: The method leveraged standard Python libraries for data handling and machine learning. Feature extraction created compact representations of tweet text, opti- mized for large-scale processing. The classifier used a stochastic gradient descent approach with a log-loss objective, designed for iterative updates. Chunked processing and memory manage- ment ensured scalability on standard hardware, completing in ∼hours. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.7743 on the validation set, with the following performance metrics across emotion classes (negative: -1, neutral: 0, positive: 1):

These results indicate strong performance for neutral and positive emotions, with high recall for neutral (0.95) and balanced precision/recall for positive (0.79/0.75). Negative emotions had high precision (0.89) but lower recall (0.22), suggesting challenges in detecting negative tweets, possibly due to class imbalance or nuanced expressions. The approach complemented LLM- based sentiment analysis by identifying nuanced emotions, e.g., anger in political tweets or sad- ness in COVID-19 discussions, enhancing insights into public mood.

Overall Implementation and Workflow
The pipeline was:
Acquisition: Load ∼24M tweet CSV.
Cleaning: MemoryOptimizedTweetCleaner for noise removal.

Enrichment: Add income (spatial joins) and ZIP codes (geocoding).
Classification: twitter-roberta for topic categorization.
Sentiment/Emotion Analysis: Mistral-7B for sentiment polarity; incremental learning for emotions.
Tools included pandas, geopandas, uszipcode, transformers, and sklearn. GPU bursts via Colab optimized heavy steps. Verifications ensured quality at each stage.

Results and Discussion
Cleaning retained ∼95% rows. Enrichment assigned income/ZIPs to ∼high % valid coordinates. Classification mapped tweets to categories, with overlaps (e.g., COVID-economics). Sentiment showed negative spikes (e.g., Q2 2020 COVID) and positive trends (e.g., vaccine rollouts). Emo- tion classification revealed nuanced patterns, e.g., anger in politics (precision 0.89 for negative), sadness in COVID tweets (high neutral recall). Geospatial concentration limited heatmap granu- larity. Future work could integrate real-time data and additional enrichments.

Conclusion
This project processed ∼24M NYC tweets, overcoming noise and multilingual challenges to re- veal sentiment and emotion patterns tied to socioeconomic factors. The incremental learning approach, with 0.7743 accuracy, enhanced emotional insights, offering a scalable framework for urban social media analysis.
